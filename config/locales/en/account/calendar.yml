          With the calendar function of the catalog we offer you the possibility to integrate relevant dates,
          that affect your library account directly into your usual calendar program.
          Currently we provide you with the following dates:
        due_date:
          title: End of loan periods
          description: >
            The calendar shows you the end of loan periods. If the loan periods of several
            media end on the same day, we combine the information into one entry.
            This way, you will never forget a return and save yourself annoying fees.
        hold_requests:
          title: Hold requests ready for pickup
          description: >
            The calendar shows you that hold requests have been provided for you and are waiting to be picked up.
            The entries are designed so that you can see directly how long the media
            are available for pickup.

          The dates are subscribed by your calendar program and automatically kept up to date. The
          means that the entries are updated automatically, e.g. when you make renewals.
          You should therefore make sure to configure your program accordingly.
